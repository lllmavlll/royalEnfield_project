        Royal Enfield was a brand name under which The Enfield Cycle Company
        Limited of Redditch, Worcestershire sold motorcycles, bicycles,
        lawnmowers and stationary engines which they had manufactured. Enfield
        Cycle Company also used the brand name "Enfield" without the "Royal".
        The first Royal Enfield motorcycle was built in 1901. The Enfield Cycle
        Company is responsible for the design and original production of the
        Royal Enfield Bullet, the longest-lived motorcycle design in history.
        Royal Enfield's spare parts operation was sold to Velocette in 1967,
        which benefitted from the arrangement for three years until their
        closure in early 1971. Enfield's remaining motorcycle business became
        part of Norton Villiers in 1967 with the business eventually closing in
        1978.

        The Continental GT 650 alongside the Interceptor 650 was introduced in
        November 2017. The café racer has either a standard dual-seat or an
        optional solo seat with a seat hump. The fuel tank is more angular than
        the roadster's. Clip-on handlebars and rear-set pegs allow a sportier
        riding position.

          <h1>Interceptor 650</h1>
        </div>
        The Royal Enfield Interceptor 650 is a parallel twin retro-styled
        motorcycle introduced by Royal Enfield in 2018. It is the first modern
        twin cylinder motorcycle developed by the company. In 2017 it was
        revealed, inspired by the 1960s Interceptor which had a 750cc engine.
        The Interceptor 650 was unveiled alongside the Continental GT 650, which
        shares the same engine. The Interceptor is a retro-cruiser with relaxed
        ergonomics, while the Continental GT is a café-racer with minor changes
        for performance. Both models are sold in India, Australasia, Europe and
        the United States. The bike is expected to become the biggest selling
        large-capacity twin in the world, and in 2020 the Interceptor 650 was
        the UK's best-selling big bike.

        </div>
        The Royal Enfield Hunter 350 is powered by the same 349cc,
        single-cylinder, air-cooled engine as the Royal Enfield Meteor 350 and
        the Classic 350. Despite a slightly sportier state of tune, it produces
        the same 20.2PS and 27Nm. The motor is paired to a five-speed gearbox.
        The Hunter is built on a split dual-cradle frame, linked to a telescopic
        fork and dual shock absorber suspension setup, same as its siblings. It
        employs a 300mm disc with a dual-piston floating calliper up front and a
        270mm disc with a single-piston floating calliper at the rear. There’s
        also the safety net of dual channel ABS or single-channel ABS in the
        more affordable Retro variant.

        model, first born in 1950’s, the all new Classic 350 continues to be a
        testament to the timeless design which took the motorcycling world with
        an awe back in the heydays of British motorcycling. The Classic teardrop
        fuel tank, the distinctive thump and the hallmark casquette headlamp -
        all harmonise as one, rejoicing in the masterpiece that is the timeless
        Royal Enfield Classic.
