# royalEnfield_project
I have created The Royal Enfield website clone using my HTMl, CSS knowledge/Skills.
It's not exactly same as the official Royal Enfield website. A simple blog kind off website about the Royal Enfield bikes. Because i like Royal Enfield bikes. 

I Didn't use any javascript to this work as of now. I may add few features in the future, but not sure about it for now

All the images has an anchor tag which redirects you to official Royal Enfield product page.
