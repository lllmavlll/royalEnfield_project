# royalEnfield_project
I have created The Royal Enfield website clone using my HTML, and CSS knowledge/Skills.
It's not exactly same as the official Royal Enfield website. A simple blog kind of website about the Royal Enfield bikes. Because I like Royal Enfield bikes. 

I Didn't use any javascript for this work as of now. I may add a few features in the future, but not sure about it for now

All the images have an anchor tag that redirects you to the official Royal Enfield product page.
